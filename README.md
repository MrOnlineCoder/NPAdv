# NP Tavern

Simple visual novel built for local Telegram group, based on the content, memes and characters, present in the chat.

## Features:

-   Written from scratch on C++
-   Uses SFML for window management, graphics, sounds
-   Uses nlohmann/json for parsing the story itself in JSON format
-   Uses lua for very simple scripting - checking for conditions in the dialogues
-   The story features 5-6 different endings, based on players choices
-   Because of my complete lack of art skills, all backgrounds and images are either generated by Midjourney AI or downloaded from OpenGameArt, with few exceptions for icons or buttons
-   Soundtrack by El Huevro and Kevin MacLeod
-   Sounds from Pixabay
-   Features 3 minigames: quick shooting, classical battleships and improvised turn-based fighting (although very unbalanced)
